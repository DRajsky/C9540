# C9540: Introduction to Computational Quantum Chemistry

## Course objectives:
The aim of this course is to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to the world of computational quantum chemistry. Following a short introduction to the elementary concepts of quantum and computational chemistry, students will gain the hands-on experience with several quantum chemical programs for single-point calculation, structure optimization, analysis of electronic structure, and simulation of experimental spectra. They will learn how to interpret the computed numbers and compare them with the experimental data. This course is recommended to everyone employing theoretical calculations in their project(s).

## Syllabus:
1. Schrodinger equation, Wavefunction, Born-Oppenheimer approximation, Hamiltonian, Basis functions
2. Potential energy surface
3. Model chemistries (Semiempirical, DFT, ab initio)
4. Molecular builders, Single point calculations
5. Geometry optimization
6. Frequency analysis, IR spectra
7. Population analysis, Potential energy scan, Reaction coordinates
8. Solvent effects: PCM and COSMO, SMD
9. Calculation of response properties: NMR
10. Calculation of UV/VIS
11. Relativistic effects: geometry and properties
12. Transition-state calculations.
